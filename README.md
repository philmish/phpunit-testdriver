# PHPUnit testdriver Extension

This package bridges PHPUnit Eventdata as JSON formatted string to stdout.
It is intended to be used with [testdriver.nvim](https://github.com/philmish/testdriver.nvim) to stream 
data in a format which is easier to parse for comprehensible test diagnostics.

I wrote this mainly to explore the Event System introduced into PHPUnit with version 10 and enhance
my own editing experience.
